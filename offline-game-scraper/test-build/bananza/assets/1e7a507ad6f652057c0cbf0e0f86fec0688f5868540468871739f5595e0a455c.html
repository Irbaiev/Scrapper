<p><strong>About <br>Crash Games</strong></p>
<div>
    <p>This is a game of chance with dynamic odds, where players place bets and watch a multiplier increase in real time. The goal is to cash out before the game crashes to secure winnings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Basic Info</strong></p>
    <p>The game interface provides key session information, including:</p>
    <p>- BALANCE: The money or credits available in the player's casino account to wager.</p>
    <p>- BET: The amount set as the current wager.</p>
    <p>- WIN: The value earned in the last round.</p>
    <p>- ROUND ID: A unique identifier for each game round, updated at the start of every round and displayed until the next game begins.</p>

    <p><strong>Game Rules</strong></p>
    <p>1. Betting Phase: Players have a set time (e.g., 10 seconds) to place their bets before the round begins.</p>
    <p>2. Multiplier Growth: Once the round starts, the multiplier begins at 1.00x and increases progressively.</p>
    <p>3. Cash Out: Players must manually cash out before the crash event to secure their winnings.</p>
    <p>4. Crash Event: The round ends at a random crash point, and any players who have not cashed out lose their bets.</p>
    <p>5. Payouts: The winnings are calculated as `cash-out multiplier × bet amount`.</p>

    <p><strong>Bet Settings</strong></p>
    <p>Players can adjust their bet amount within a predefined range using the controls in the betting section. Some crash games allow placing multiple simultaneous bets.</p>

    <p><strong>Auto Cash Out</strong></p>
    <p>Players can set a predefined multiplier at which the game will automatically cash out their bet, ensuring they lock in winnings without manual intervention.</p>

    <p><strong>Playing the Game</strong></p>
    <p>1. Set the desired bet amount and place the bet before the round starts.</p>
    <p>2. Watch the multiplier increase in real time.</p>
    <p>3. Click "Cash Out" at any moment before the crash to secure winnings.</p>
    <p>4. If the multiplier crashes before cashing out, the bet is lost.</p>
